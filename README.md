# Content Learning Tracker

A tool for capturing and reviewing insights from educational content.

## Overview

My first project. Built it because I needed a way to save notes from videos/podcasts and review them later.

## What It Does

- Quick capture notes from videos/podcasts
- Random review with spaced repetition
- Filter by topics
- Clean, simple interface

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- localStorage (no backend needed)

## How It Works

1. Add notes while watching/listening to content
2. Tag with topics
3. Review random notes later (spaced repetition style)
4. Filter by topic to focus on specific areas

## What I Learned

- Shipping something > perfect plans
- Using AI to build stuff is totally viable now
- You don't need to be an expert to build things
- Just get it done and move on

## Development

Built entirely with AI assistance. I had an idea, AI helped me build it. The code works, that's all that matters.

## Notes

This was vibecoded with AI. I'm not a developer and not trying to become one. Just wanted to build something useful and I did.

## Run It
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000
