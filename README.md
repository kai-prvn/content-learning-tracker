# content learning tracker

a tool for capturing and reviewing insights from educational content.

my first project. built it to learn by doing.

## what it does

- quick capture notes from videos/podcasts
- random review (spaced repetition)
- topic filtering
- simple interface

## tech

- react + typescript (used AI to help while learning)
- tailwind css
- localStorage

## what i learned

- shipping something > perfect plans
- using AI to build while learning is normal now
- building teaches way more than tutorials
- you figure out what you like by actually doing it

## what's next

experimenting with different approaches:
- understanding the code better (learning react properly)
- redesigning it in figma (exploring design)
- maybe rebuilding in framer (trying no-code)

figuring out which part i enjoy most.

---

built by someone figuring it out. that's the point.
