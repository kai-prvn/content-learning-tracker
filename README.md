# content learning tracker

a tool for capturing and reviewing insights from educational content.

built this as my first project. used AI + React to build it in a weekend.

## the truth

i built this to learn. turns out: i don't actually like coding.

i like the creative/design side more. so i'm pivoting to ui/ux design and no-code tools.

this project stays here as:
- proof i can ship things
- reminder that it's okay to try something and realize it's not for you
- my first step in figuring out what i actually want to do

## what it does

- quick capture notes from videos/podcasts
- random review (spaced repetition)
- topic filtering
- simple, clean interface

## tech

- react + typescript (used AI heavily because i was learning)
- tailwind css
- localStorage for data

## what i learned

- how to ship something even when you don't know what you're doing
- using AI to build is normal now
- building teaches you way more than tutorials
- **most importantly: i learned i don't like coding. i like designing.**

## what's next

redesigning this in figma to actually look good.

then rebuilding in framer (no code).

focusing on ui/ux design from now on.

if you're also figuring out what you like by trying things, we're on the same journey.
