## 🎯 The Problem

As a student consuming diverse educational content (videos, podcasts, documentaries), I kept forgetting key insights within days. I had no simple system to capture and review what I learned.

## ✨ The Solution

Built a quick-capture system with spaced repetition - a random review feature that surfaces old notes to help retain learnings long-term.

## 🚀 Features

- **Quick Capture**: Save notes with title, insight, topic, and optional source link (< 30 seconds)
- **Random Review**: Spaced repetition system - shows random notes from your collection
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by topic or search across all notes
- **Clean Design**: Mobile-first, calming colors, distraction-free interface
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes saved locally in browser (localStorage)
- **Privacy-First**: All data stays on your device, nothing sent to servers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Development**: Built with Bolt.new (AI-assisted)


## 🏃 Running Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kai-prvn/content-learning-tracker.git
cd content-learning-tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## 📱 Usage

1. **Add a Note**: Click "Add New Note", fill in what you learned
2. **Review Randomly**: Click "Review Random Note" for spaced repetition
3. **Search/Filter**: Use search or topic filters to find specific notes
4. **Delete**: Hover over a note card and click delete (with confirmation)

## 💡 What I Learned

This was my first full project, teaching me:

- **Product Thinking**: Going from problem → solution → features
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Using Bolt.new to accelerate building
- **React Fundamentals**: Components, state management, hooks
- **TypeScript**: Type safety in a real project
- **localStorage API**: Client-side data persistence
- **Deployment**: From local dev to live app
- **Troubleshooting**: Debugging issues, making technical tradeoffs

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Export notes as Markdown/CSV
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Edit existing notes inline
- [ ] Rich text formatting
- [ ] Desktop/mobile apps (PWA)
- [ ] Cloud sync (optional, privacy-preserving)
- [ ] Browser extension for quick capture
- [ ] Integration with Notion/Obsidian

## 🎓 Project Context

**Built as**: Project #1 in my product development learning journey  
**Timeline**: ~2 hours over 1 day  
**Status**: Active personal use, iterating based on real usage  
**Purpose**: Learning to ship products, not just code
